# Genetic Algorithm Optimization for OFDM Systems
## Description
This repository contains the code, results, and scientific paper made for a project applying a Genetic Algorithm to optimize OFDM systems, this project was done in partnership with the nationaltelecomunications agency of Brazil(ANATEL) surpervised by the national institute of telecomunications,Inatel college. It focuses on reducing latency and energy consumption in wireless transmissions and improving system performance, this is was achieved by reducing PAPR on OFDM signals.

---

### What's Inside
- **Code**: Generation of the OFDM signals and the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for optimizing OFDM signals.
- **Graphs/Results**: Performance metrics and visualizations demonstrating the algorithm's impact.
- **Paper**: Detailed scientific paper explaining the methodology, results, and findings.

---

### Features
- Tackles latency and energy consumption issues in OFDM systems.
- Utilizes Genetic Algorithms for reducing Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR).
- Open-source project designed for collaboration and further exploration.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and any other dependencies (refer to `requirements.txt` if included).

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MattRangell/GA_PAPR_Reduction.git
   cd GA_PAPR_Reduction
   ```   
2. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` is provided):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Usage
1. Run the main script to start the optimization:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Customize the algorithm for different OFDM configurations or test new parameters.
